As the Ramadhan month is coming, so the most important prayer times that need to be alert in Ramadhan are Maghrib and Subuh. So that, this application is built to obtain the latest and precise prayer time from the open api that source from aladhan. Read full documentation of the api [here](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api).
Note that this api is using Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, Singapore method of prayer time calculation as it is the only the closest to the JAKIM method.
Cheers.
